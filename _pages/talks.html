     Dr. Natasha Sekhon [pronoun. <i>say-kho</i>] is an Assistant Professor of Geology at Occidental College. 
     Natasha received her B.S. from the University of California, Irvine, followed by a M.S. and Ph.D. from University of Texas, Austin. She was a postdoctoral researcher
     at Brown Univerisity as a Voss Postdoc Research Associate and Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow. Dr. Sekhon studies changes in the hydroclimate cycle through time using stable isotope and trace element geochemistry.

<u>Mira Hart ('26)</u><br>
     Mira is the longest WICK Lab member! <br>
     Mira has been working on projects in the Philippines. On a <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/student-research/urc/student-funding-projects-travel/asp-research-travel-grants">URC ASP Research Travel Grant</a>, Mira assisted Dr. Sekhon in the Philippines for 10 days. Field work is an integral part of the WICK Lab, and <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/magazine/issues/spring-2025/underground-history-climate-change">Mira helped collect cave monitoring data and stalagmite samples.</a> Mira is working on her Senior Comps investigating how tropical hydroclimate responds to periods of Rapid Climate Change. She is working on the stable isotope and trace element reconstruction of two stalagmites that grew over Heinrich Stadials 2 - 4. <br> 
     When she is not in the lab, she enjoys trying new coffee shops, spending time with friends, and exploring Los Angeles. You will also find Mira outside hiking, playing golf, or paddle boarding.

<u>Jivleen Parmar ('27)</u><br>
     Jivleen is working as a Directed Research student in the WICK Lab. She is helping Dr. Sekhon set up the lab's Picarro instrument for analyses. This involves testing sensitivity of the new instrument, setting up in-house lab standards and measuring unknowns. Jivleen is also working towards analyzing Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall for stable isotopes. In her free time, Jivleen enjoys reading, gardening, and playing the drums.
