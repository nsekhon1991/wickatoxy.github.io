<u>Jivleen Parmar ('27)</u><br>
     Jivleen is working as a Directed Research student in the WICK Lab. She is helping Dr. Sekhon set up the lab's Picarro instrument for analyses. This involves testing sensitivity of the new instrument, setting up in-house lab standards and measuring unknowns. Jivleen is also working towards analyzing Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall for stable isotopes. In her free time, Jivleen enjoys reading, gardening, and playing the drums.
