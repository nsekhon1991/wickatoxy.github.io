At Occidental College, Prof. Sekhon teaches courses in <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/geology/courses-requirements">Geology</a> covering a wide range from Introductory to Upper-Level. 
<p>
<b>Earth: Our Environment (GEO105)</b><br>
<i>Introduction to Geology with emphasis on the physical processes 
that shape the environment on the Earth's surface. The course will cover the 
fundamentals of plate tectonics, rocks, minerals, geologic time, surface processes, 
and Earth's interior. Special attention will be paid to geologic hazards 
(such as earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, and landslides), the history and future of global climate change, 
and the human impact on the environment.</i>

<p>
<b>Water in a Changing World (GEO210)</b><br>
<i>This course will explore the physical principles, processes, and dynamics of the water cycle, 
including how and where water is transformed and transported around the planet. Topics will include the 
distribution of water on Earth, the main components of the hydrologic cycle (e.g. the storage and exchange of 
water phases between ocean, land, and atmosphere), and extreme weather and climate phenomena such as 
atmospheric rivers, floods, monsoons, hurricanes, and  drought. The profound impacts of climate change and a 
growing human population on the hydrologic cycle and water resources on global and regional scales, especially in 
California, will be emphasized.</i>

<p>
<b>Integrative Topics: Environmental Geochemistry (GEO380)</b><br>
<i>Low-temperature geochemical techniques are used to understand the global and local 
  circulation of water from the atmosphere through rocks and into groundwater. In this course 
  we will learn how stable isotope and trace elements help define the transport of water, metals, 
  and carbon under changing climate and land-use conditions. Labs will give students an opportunity to
  apply geochemical tools to a variety of real world settings, using data from the Rocky Mountain headwater 
  catchments to the karst aquifers in central Texas. A final collaborative class project will provide students 
  the unique opportunity to sample, prepare, analyze, and interpret their own stable isotope data using a Picarro i
  nstrument in Dr. Sekhon’s laboratory.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Senior Seminar (GEO491)</b><br>
<i>This seminar focuses on analysis, discussion, and presentation of current issues in geological research. 
  These topics will be explored through the geologic literature and the class will include a formal presentation to the 
  Geology Department. Students will also learn about graduate school and career options in the Earth Sciences. 
  Open only to senior Geology majors.</i>
