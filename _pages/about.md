At the Water Isotopes, Climate and Karst (WICK) Lab we investigate hydroclimate variability from the atmosphere to the subsurface. 

Our research is anchored to the disciplines of low-temperature traditional isotope systems and trace-element geochemistry, hydrology within karst landscapes, speleothem sciences, and terrestrial paleoclimatotolgy.
